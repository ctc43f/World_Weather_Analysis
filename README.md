# World_Weather_Analysis

The analysis in this directory is related to the Module 6 challenge assignment.  Three items are:

1. Pulling weather data from OpenWeather using APIs for 2,000 randomly generated longitudes and latitudes
2. Using Google Maps to locate the nearest hotels to those random longitudes and latitudes based on the desired temperature range for a user
3. Using Google Maps to create a transportation path to four relatively close locations and show the hotels at each stop from step 2
